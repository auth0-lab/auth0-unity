# Security Policy

This document outlines the Responsible Disclosure Program for Auth0
open source software.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

At Auth0 we take security seriously and consider it a top priority. Since a
public disclosure of a security vulnerability could put the entire Auth0
community at risk, we require that potential vulnerabilities are kept
confidential until they are confirmed and fixed. We appreciate your efforts in
keeping Auth0 and its users safe by responsibly disclosing any security
vulnerability. Rest assured we will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Any security related issue should be reported to Auth0 via the form at the
bottom of the [Responsible Disclosure Policy
page](https://auth0.com/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

If individuals prefer to directly communicate with the Auth0 security team,
they are invited to send an email to security@auth0.com For encrypted
communication, you can download our PGP key from
